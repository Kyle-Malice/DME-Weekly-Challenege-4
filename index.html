          The Washington Monument is an obelisk shaped building within the National Mall in Washington, D.C., 
          built to commemorate George Washington, once commander-in-chief of the Continental Army (1775–1784) 
          in the American Revolutionary War and the first President of the United States (1789–1797). Located 
          almost due east of the Reflecting Pool and the Lincoln Memorial, the monument, made of marble, 
          granite, and bluestone gneiss,[3] is both the world's tallest predominantly stone structure and the 
          world's tallest obelisk, standing 554 feet (169.046m) tall according to the U.S. 
          National Geodetic Survey (measured 2013–14) or 555feet 5+1⁄8inches (169.294 m) tall, according to 
          the National Park Service (measured 1884). It is the tallest monumental column in the world if 
          all are measured above their pedestrian entrances. It was the tallest structure in the world between 
          1884 and 1889, after which it was overtaken by the Eiffel Tower in Paris. Previously, the tallest structure 
          was the Cologne Cathedral. <a href="#p5"><sub>1</sub></a>

    <h3>
      History
    </h3> 

        <p id="p1">

          George Washington (1732–1799), hailed as the father of his country, and as the leader who was "first in war, 
          first in peace and first in the hearts of his countrymen" (in eulogy by Maj. Gen. 'Light-Horse Harry' Lee at 
          Washington's funeral, December 26, 1799), was the dominant military and political leader of the new United 
          States of America from 1775 to 1799. Even his former enemy King George III called him "the greatest character 
          of the age".<br><br>

          At his death in 1799, he left a critical legacy: Washington was the unchallenged public icon of American military 
          and civic patriotism. He was also identified with the Federalist Party, which lost control of the national government 
          in 1800 to the Jeffersonian Republicans, who were reluctant to celebrate the hero of the opposition party. <a href="#p6"><sub>2</sub></a>

    <h4>
      Construction
    </h4>
       
       <p id="p2">

        Construction of the presidential memorial began in 1848 and was halted for a period of 23 years, from 1854 
        to 1877 due to a lack of funds, a struggle for control over the Washington National Monument Society, and 
        the American Civil War. Although the stone structure was completed in 1884, internal ironwork, the knoll, 
        and installation of memorial stones were not completed until 1888. A difference in shading of the marble, 
        visible approximately 150 feet (46m) or 27% up, shows where construction was halted and later resumed with 
        marble from a different source. The original design was by Robert Mills (1781–1855) of South Carolina, but 
        he did not include his proposed colonnade due to a lack of funds, proceeding only with a bare obelisk. The 
        cornerstone was laid on July 4, 1848; the first stone was laid atop the unfinished stump on August 7, 1880; 
        the capstone was set on December 6, 1884; the completed monument was dedicated on February 21, 1885;[14] and 
        officially opened October 9, 1888. <a href="#p7"><sub>3</sub></a>

       </p>

    <h5>
      Deadication
    </h5>

       <p id="p3">

        The Monument was dedicated on February 21, 1885. Over 800 people were present on the monument grounds to 
        hear speeches during a frigid day by Ohio Senator John Sherman (1823–1900), the Rev. Henderson Suter, William 
        Wilson Corcoran (of the Washington National Monument Society) read by Dr. James C. Welling because Corcoran was 
        unable to attend, Freemason Myron M. Parker, Col. Thomas Lincoln Casey of the Army Corps of Engineers, and 
        President Chester A. Arthur. President Arthur proclaimed:<br><br>
  
        "I do now .... in behalf of the people, receive this monument .... and declare it dedicated from this time forth to 
        the immortal name and memory of George Washington." <br><br>
   
        After the speeches Lieutenant-General Philip Sheridan (1831–1888), Civil War Cavalry veteran and then General-in-Chief 
        of the United States Army led a procession, which included the dignitaries and the crowd, past the Executive Mansion, 
        now the White House, then via Pennsylvania Avenue to the east main entrance of the Capitol, where 21st President Chester 
        Arthur (1829–1886, served 1881–1885) received passing troops. Then, in the House of Representatives Chamber at the U.S. 
        Capitol, the president, his Cabinet, diplomats and others listened to Representative John Davis Long (1838–1915), 
        (former Lieutenant Governor and Governor of Massachusetts and future Secretary of the Navy) read a speech written a 
        few months earlier by Robert C. Winthrop (1809–1894), formerly the Speaker of the House of Representatives when the 
        cornerstone was laid 37 years earlier in 1848, but now too ill to personally deliver his speech.[28]: 234–260  A final 
        speech was given by John W. Daniel (1842–1910), of Virginia, a well-regarded lawyer, author and Representative (congressman), 
        and Senator. The festivities concluded that evening with fireworks, both aerial and ground displays. <a href="#p8"><sub>4</sub></a>

      Later History

       <p id="p4"> 

        At completion, it was the tallest building in the world, until the Eiffel Tower was completed four years later in Paris 
        in 1889. It is still the tallest building in Washington, D.C. The Heights of Buildings Act of 1910 restricts new 
        building heights to no more than 20 feet (6.1m) greater than the width of the adjacent street.[54] This monument is taller 
        than the obelisks around the capitals of Europe and in Egypt and Ethiopia, but ordinary antique obelisks were quarried as 
        a monolithic block of stone, and were therefore seldom taller than approximately 100 feet (30m).<a href="#p9"><sub>5</sub></a>
